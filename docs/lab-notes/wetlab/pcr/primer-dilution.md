## Objectives

This objective of this procedure is to dilute the ordered primer to working concentration for PCR procedures.

## Methods

:::note
Keep primer on ice bucket during experiment. Store in <Measure unit="degC">-20</Measure> Freezer. 
:::

### Stock Solution

1. Spin down for <Measure unit="s">~5</Measure> in bubble spinner.
1. Dilute the primer to <Measure unit="um">100</Measure> with TE or Tris.

:::note
EDTA is not a suitable buffer to put in PCR as it can prevent polymerase from working.

### Working Solution

1. Spin down for <Measure unit="s">~5</Measure> in bubble spinner.
1. Dilute <Measure unit="um">100</Measure> stock solution to <Measure unit="um">10</Measure> working solution.


## Next Steps

Continue preparing PCR mixture.
